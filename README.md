Material Foundation 2.0
======================= 

High Quality, clean metal and composite materials put into a mod.

All materials are 64x64 px to give more detail than normal.

Can paint iron materials to give colour.

Requires Ender IO or any mod that has Dark Steel for some recipes to work.

All recipes have JEI support.


Tools used:

Photoshop CC
Illustrator CC
Filter Forge 4

Most materials are highly modified Filter Forge presets.
All source materials are 512x512 px and a HD texture pack can be made (just ask!)

Was formerly an unreleased add on mod for Thermal Foundation.
