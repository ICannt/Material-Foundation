Material Foundation 2
===================== 

High Quality, clean metal and composite materials put into a mod.

All materials are 64x64 px to give more detail than normal.

Can paint iron materials to give colour (upcoming feature).

Tools used:

Photoshop CC
Illustrator CC
Filter Forge 4

Most materials are highly modified Filter Forge presets.
All source materials are 512x512 px and a HD texture pack can be made (just ask!)

Was formerly an unreleased add on mod for Thermal Foundation.
